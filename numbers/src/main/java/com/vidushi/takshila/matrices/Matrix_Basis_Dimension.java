	The result for the same can be obtained by checking whether the determinant of the matrix formed by vectors is zero or not. 
	If the determinant is non zero its forms the basis for the given dimension, not otherwise.
	Here is the source code of the Java Program to Find Basis and Dimension of a Matrix. The Java program 
	is successfully compiled and run on a Windows system. The program output is also shown below.
